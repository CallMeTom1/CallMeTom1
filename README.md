# Hey, I'm Thomas Baar 🙋‍♂️

## About Me
I am a computer science student 👨‍💻 currently learning and developing my skills. I strive to learn 📚 as much as I can and get hands-on experience with various technologies. I am very curious and love exploring new fields. 🚀

## Currently Working On
I'm currently working on **Euro-Sky-Star** ✈️, a school web project with a microservice architecture 🛠️ . This project uses gRPC for communication, Kafka for handling messages, and an API gateway with REST HTTP. 
The backend is developed in TypeScript with NestJS.
I am also building the front end with Angular 🅰️.

I am also preparing for tech interviews 🧠 with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/baarthomas/) and learning algorithms and data structures.

I have a keen interest in quantitative finance 📈, where I experiment with AI 🤖, improve my statistics and math skills , and gain knowledge of financial markets. 💡

I'm also diving into writing articles about the technologies I use in my projects. You can find them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@baarthomas). 📝 Have a look and feel free to leave a clap and comment!
